# Hamza
Hamza is a lightweight, fast and portable C90 [OpenType](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec) library.
It was written to be primarily for Arabic but supporting other languages ended up not being too bad.
Latin scripts are mostly simple, some of them are a bit more complicated like Vietnamese.
